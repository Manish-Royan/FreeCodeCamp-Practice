# This is Step 6

We will be learning about nesting. In the previous step, we put the ``h1``, ``h2``, ``comment``, and ``p`` elements inside the ``main`` element. That is called ``nesting``. 

Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element they are nested in. This spacing is called **indentation** and it is used to make HTML easier to read.

## Examples

```HTML
<main>
  <h1>Most important content of the document</h1>
  <p>Some more important content...</p>
</main>```

## Task

The ``h1`` element, ``h2`` element and the comment are indented two spaces more than the ``main`` element in the code below. **Use the space bar on your keyboard to add two more spaces in front of the ``p`` element so that it is indented properly as well.**

**• Before**

```HTML
      <main>
      <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
      <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
      <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
    <p>See more cat photos in our gallery.</p>
    </main>
```

**• After**
```HTML
       <main>
      <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
      <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
      <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
      <p>See more cat photos in our gallery.</p>
    </main>
```
