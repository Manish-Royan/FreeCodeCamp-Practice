# This is Step 9

We will be learning about `alt` attribute. **All img elements should have an `alt` attribute**. The `alt` attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

## Examples

```HTML
    <img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat">
```

## Task

Add an ``alt`` attribute with this text: *A cute orange cat lying on its back* ,inside the ``img`` element.

**â€¢ Add**

```HTML
      <main>
      <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
      <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
      <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
      <p>See more cat photos in our gallery.</p>
      <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back">
      </main>
```
