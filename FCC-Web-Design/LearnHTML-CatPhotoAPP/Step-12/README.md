# This is Step 12

We learned that we can turn any text into a link, such as the text inside of a `p` element.

## Examples

```HTML
    <p>I think <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a> is great.</p>
```

## Task

Turn the word ***cat photos*** in `p` element into a link by adding opening and closing anchor `a` tags around these words, then set the `href` attribute to *`https://freecatphotoapp.com`*


**â€¢ Add**

```HTML
       <main>
            <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
            <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
            <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
            <p>See more <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">cat photos</a> in our gallery.</p>
            <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back">
            <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">link to cat pictures</a>     
       </main>
```
