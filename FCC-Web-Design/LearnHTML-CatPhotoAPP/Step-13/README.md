# This is Step 13



## Task

Since we turned the text ***cat photos*** inside the `p` element into a link, we don't need the second link below the `p` element. So, delete the entire anchor element `a` below the `p` element.
**â€¢ DO**

```HTML
       <main>
            <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
            <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
            <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
           <p>See more <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">cat photos</a> in our gallery.</p>
            <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back">
       </main>
```
