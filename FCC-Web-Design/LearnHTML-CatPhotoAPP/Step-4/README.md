# This is Step 4

We will be learning about the **comment**. Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive.

A comment in HTML starts with ``<!--``, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with ``-->``.

## Examples

```HTML
<!-- Comment -->
```

## Task

Add a comment above the ``p`` element with this text:

**TODO: Add link to cat photos**

**• From**

```HTML
 <p>See more <cat photos in our gallery.</p>
```

**• To**

```HTML
 <!--TODO: Add link to cat photos-->
 <p>See more cat photos in our gallery.</p>
```
