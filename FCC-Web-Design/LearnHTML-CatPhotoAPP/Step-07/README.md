# This is Step 7

We will be learning about adding ``<img>`` tag and know that it is **self-closing tag**. We can add images to our website by using the *img element*. **img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag**. 

**A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a self-closing tag**.

## Examples

```HTML
    <img> <!-- it is example of slef closing tag -->
```

## Task

Add an ``img`` element below the ``p`` element.

**â€¢ Add**

```HTML
      <main>
      <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
      <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
      <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
      <p>See more cat photos in our gallery.</p>
      <img>
    </main>
```
